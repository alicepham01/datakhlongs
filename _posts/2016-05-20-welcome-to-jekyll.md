The rapid urbanization and population growth in metropolitan regions have led to increased challenges in the transportation sector, particularly concerning traffic congestion and limited accessibility. Water-based transportation systems, such as waterbuses, have emerged as a viable solution to these issues, promoting sustainable urban mobility while enhancing connectivity and accessibility. This abstract presents a comprehensive analysis of the successful implementation and impact of the Klong Saen Saep Boat Service in Thailand.

The case studies focus on developing the Klong Saen Saep Boat Service, a waterbus network that operates along the Saen Saep Canal, serving as a major transportation artery in Bangkok and neighboring provinces. By exploring the planning, design, and operational strategies, this research elucidates the key factors contributing to its success and highlights the lessons learned from its implementation.

This study examines the successful implementation of the Klong Saen Saep Boat Service in Bangkok, Thailand, as a waterbus network to improve urban connectivity and accessibility. The study employed qualitative methods, using participatory observation methods and relevant sources and scientific articles alongside the **Computer Vision** and **Urban Network Analysis** plugins to assess connectivity and accessibility. Through analyzing key factors such as government involvement, private sector participation, and community engagement, the paper highlights the positive impacts of this water-based transport system on reducing travel times and enhancing mobility. The findings underscore the potential of such systems as sustainable solutions for urban transportation challenges in other Asian cities.
